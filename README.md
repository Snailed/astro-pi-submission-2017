# Determination of GDP per Capita by Light Pollution and Population

## Theme: B

## Team name: Equation Quotation

## Idea:
We have a hypothesis that a city’s light pollution can correlate to its relative wealth. When watching satellite photos of cities at night, the light from street lamps, offices and homes can clearly be distinguished from the rest of earth. We suspect that a city with a high GDP per capita will emit a high level of light pollution, indicating that we might be able to predict a city’s wealth per inhabitant using photos of it at night. If we can prove our hypothesis, then we might be able to deduct a function that describes the wealth of different cities based on these variables. We hope to learn from the conclusions of the experiment and maybe have subsequent discussions in an anthropology class or political science class.

## How we will use the Astro Pi:
By calculating the ISS’ position and measuring the light level of the Earth as seen from the ISS, we would like to turn Izzy’s camera into a sensor that takes detects and takes images of Earth cities at night. We also want to incorporate the infrared camera both as detection sensor and for later dual band image processing. The images will be stored for later processing and evaluation by the team. We plan to use machine learning to execute the experiment as we are curious about this particular approach to problem solving and possible future applications.
